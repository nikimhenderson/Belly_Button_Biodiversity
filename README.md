# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a web application dashboard using Javascript and Plotly to display an individual test subjects belly button bacteria data from the [Belly Button Bio Diversity Dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) from the Rob Dunn Lab. Each test subjects data can be selected and viewed. The results to be displayed were:
1. Demographic Information
2. Bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found
3. Bubble chart of bacteria cultures per sample

## Resources
Data Source: samples.json
Software: VS Code, Javascript, Plotly, D3, HTML

## Results
The data reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## How to use
